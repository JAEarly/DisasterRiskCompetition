- No sampling much better than avg sampling in this case.
- Sum based weighting comparable to no weighting when using no sampling; ditch avg sampling.
- Dropout most effective when not using class weighting (trying to solve the same problem).
- Relationship between epochs and drop out unclear, try increasing both values.
