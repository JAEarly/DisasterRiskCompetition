- Class weight almost always makes things worse. With no sampling the difference of using the
  sum based weighting makes very little difference so consider this going forward. Ditch the max
  based weighting as it makes things much worse.
- More epochs seems to make things worse in general, but some interesting results where an
  improvement is seen when using max based weighting.
- Generally, no sampling and avg sampling perform best - keep using these.
